This automation suite uses selenium and python for automation
Install selenium, chrome webdriver, python 3

Test suite loads provided url, verifies that its loaded
It then verifies presence of item table elements on the page 
Add an item to the table as an expense, make sure monetary values changes and item was added to the table 
Add income to the table, make sure monetary values changed 
When monetary value of an item exceeds 300, working balance does not change by the right amount, so that test fails
Also when checking URL, there is a hashtag in the loaded url, so that test fails
